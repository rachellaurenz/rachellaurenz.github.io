    <u>Tsing, Anna L. On anthropogenic landscapes, In: A Bestiary of the Anthropocene, edited by N. Nova + DISNOVATION.org</u><br>
While reading this article, nothing caught my attention right away. Anthropocene was a word I had never heard before and I did enjoy learning about what it means and what are some myths about the definition. 
I also found this article difficult to understand. I know that it was about coal mines, fungi, and trees, but I do not understand how they all connect. 
I know that the article probably states it a bunch of times and I would just have to re-read everything a few more times to understand. The vocabulary in this was also higher than my understanding and many words went over my head. 
A quote that stood out to me more than the other lines was “common sense still tends to push human diversity to something from archaic times, something overcome by process, but diversity today is thoroughly modern, even when it makes use of ancient legacies.” 
I do not understand the whole quote, but after a few DuckDuckGo searches and a couple ChatGPT questions I think I know the main point: some people think that diversity is old fashioned but it is actually very important and relevant. 
I have no idea how that fits with the coal mine and fungi, but it is an intriguing quote nonetheless. When I first picked the quote, I did not know what it meant, but it stuck out to me mostly because it started with “common sense” and said “but diversity today is thoroughly modern.” 
Common sense caught my attention because while attempting to read this, nothing felt like common sense. The other part of the quote that I pointed out felt relevant to our society today. Diversity is a word that I hear every day and thinking about how it has been modernized is an interesting thought. 
Throughout the years the word diversity has changed the weight and sometimes meaning, it has changed the same as our society has to stay relevant, and it is probably a word we will always have around.

<u>Wall Kimmerer, Robin. Learning to See, in Gathering Moss: A Natural and Cultural History of Mosses</u><br>
The quote “how is it possible that I can no longer see what was once so plain” stuck out to me a lot. It is very poetic and yet I have no idea what the author is talking about. 
Earlier the author created the metaphor between flying in an airplane to being frozen in time with our “chapters” on pause. Does the quote relate to the comparison because the line before she was talking about a page? 
Or is it simply that her vision is going bad from old age while looking at a map or book? After re-reading it a few more times it seems more likely that it is just about her bad vision that was once there and now she lost, but the idea of it being a metaphor still intrigues me. 
There are so many other metaphors within the story and there are so many different meanings that it could represent. Maybe her memory is getting old and she is trying to remember things about other people’s lives but can not remember them. 
That would go with a line in the first paragraph that says “all our stories escape us except our own.” If that was the case then she could eventually lose her memories too. Other than memories, she could have also meant goals and a purpose for living. 
The first quote could mean that she knew what she wanted in life before but now she does not know what she wants or what her goals are. Maybe that is because she fulfilled her dreams and hopes and now has to find a new one. 
Maybe her dream is more complicated than what she originally thought and does not know what to do. Maybe she does not remember what her childhood dream was. The possibilities are endless when it comes from this quote.
