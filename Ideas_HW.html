    <u>Tsing, Anna L. On anthropogenic landscapes, In: A Bestiary of the Anthropocene, edited by N. Nova + DISNOVATION.org</u><br>
While reading this article, nothing caught my attention right away. Anthropocene was a word I had never heard before and I did enjoy learning about what it means and what are some myths about the definition. 
I also found this article difficult to understand. I know that it was about coal mines, fungi, and trees, but I do not understand how they all connect. 
I know that the article probably states it a bunch of times and I would just have to re-read everything a few more times to understand. The vocabulary in this was also higher than my understanding and many words went over my head. 
A quote that stood out to me more than the other lines was “common sense still tends to push human diversity to something from archaic times, something overcome by process, but diversity today is thoroughly modern, even when it makes use of ancient legacies.” 
I do not understand the whole quote, but after a few DuckDuckGo searches and a couple ChatGPT questions I think I know the main point: some people think that diversity is old fashioned but it is actually very important and relevant. 
I have no idea how that fits with the coal mine and fungi, but it is an intriguing quote nonetheless. When I first picked the quote, I did not know what it meant, but it stuck out to me mostly because it started with “common sense” and said “but diversity today is thoroughly modern.” 
Common sense caught my attention because while attempting to read this, nothing felt like common sense. The other part of the quote that I pointed out felt relevant to our society today. Diversity is a word that I hear every day and thinking about how it has been modernized is an interesting thought. 
Throughout the years the word diversity has changed the weight and sometimes meaning, it has changed the same as our society has to stay relevant, and it is probably a word we will always have around.

  <u>Wall Kimmerer, Robin. Learning to See, in Gathering Moss: A Natural and Cultural History of Mosses</u><br>
The quote “how is it possible that I can no longer see what was once so plain” stuck out to me a lot. It is very poetic and yet I have no idea what the author is talking about. 
Earlier the author created the metaphor between flying in an airplane to being frozen in time with our “chapters” on pause. Does the quote relate to the comparison because the line before she was talking about a page? 
Or is it simply that her vision is going bad from old age while looking at a map or book? After re-reading it a few more times it seems more likely that it is just about her bad vision that was once there and now she lost, but the idea of it being a metaphor still intrigues me. 
There are so many other metaphors within the story and there are so many different meanings that it could represent. Maybe her memory is getting old and she is trying to remember things about other people’s lives but can not remember them. 
That would go with a line in the first paragraph that says “all our stories escape us except our own.” If that was the case then she could eventually lose her memories too. Other than memories, she could have also meant goals and a purpose for living. 
The first quote could mean that she knew what she wanted in life before but now she does not know what she wants or what her goals are. Maybe that is because she fulfilled her dreams and hopes and now has to find a new one. 
Maybe her dream is more complicated than what she originally thought and does not know what to do. Maybe she does not remember what her childhood dream was. The possibilities are endless when it comes from this quote.

    <u>Artist Anicka Yi Explains Why COVID-19 Is Terrible for Humanity, But Fundamentally ‘Good for the Planet’</u><br>
When reading this article the first quote that popped out to me (other than the title) was “Viruses punish winners. If one species becomes too greedy, if one species is too dominant, then it actually needs to go dormant for a while.” All while growing up and including now my father hunts deer. When I was old enough to know that the deer we eat is the deer I see in the fields next to our house and they are animals with feelings and lives, I began to wonder why my father (and most of my family) shoot them. My dad has justified this by saying that if the population becomes too big then diseases will start to spread and then they die a much worse death than a quick bullet. For a few years as a kid I did not like that answer because we are still the cause of their death, but as I grow older, I understand that it is okay for us to kill them when we plan on eating them and preventing them from dying by disease in which case their body can not be used by anything and might get other animals sick. Although I do have to keep reminding myself of this and as much as I love the taste of venison, I could never shoot or skin the deer myself. I have often thought about how humans have overpopulated the world, which brings me to a question I ask myself quite frequently: what would people do if it was any other creature that was overpopulating and causing disturbance in the world the way humans do? With there being few to no natural predators left for humans, our own diseases are now our enemy, trying to get us back to populace that is even to what the Earth can handle.

    <u>Gilbert, Scott F.,  Holobiont by Birth: Multilineage Individuals as the Concretion of Cooperative Processes</u><br>
    “Our mouths are different ecosystems than our intestines, or our skin, or our airways,” was the quote that peaked my interest the most. When I think of ecosystems I think of the different biomes that make up the Earth. I had heard that sloths have a full ecosystem in their fur once or twice and I have been told about the different organisms that live on us, without us knowing. Reading that each of our bodies have about 160 species of bacteria and ecosystems was fascinating. I wonder how many of those bacteria have a mutualistic relationship vs a Commensalism or a parasitic relationship. The main reason I picked this quote is because it got me thinking about an Instagram reel I watched recently about the different temperatures our body needs. Internally, externally, and the food we put in our mouth have all different preferred temperatures that I had never thought of before. Inside our body is 98 degrees Fahrenheit while on the outside of our body 98 degrees is hot. Although 98 degrees is very cold for the food we eat, that is better at temperatures near 130 degrees (depending on the food), but we would die if our internal temperature was that high and we would melt if it was that hot outside. The most comfortable temperature for the outside of our body is probably 70 degrees which would also internally kill us and be way too cold for food. Why does our body regulate temperatures so differently for different areas? Likewise, why can our food be anywhere between 130 degrees to the temperature of our fridge, while our inside body temperature can only move a few degrees, and our external degrees can shift dramatically depending on the amount of clothes we wear? What would life be like if our inside temperature could fluctuate, like our food and outside temperature, without us getting sick?
